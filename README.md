# Java Project

This java project is about a client-server mode and **E2EE** chat program based on socket and **Signal Protocol**.

## Alias

The whole project is divided into two parts: server and client. Both projects are built with `gradle6` and `jdk11`.

## Current Function

* Login validation via jdbc.
* Send text message or audio to ~~all connected clients~~ or single connected client.
* Local chat history in client memory.
* Can send some emoji in chat.
* Show current online clients.
* Use TLS connection.
* Show if the message is sent.
* Search chat record at local.
* Group chat.
* ~~Clients' text chat data stored in database.~~
* Single E2EE chat between two clients.
* Save storages at client local.

## TODO List

- [] Server stores unreceived message until the receiver is online.
- [] Save history message at client local.
- [] Client appends pre keys to database.
- [] Client update signed pre key in database.
- [] Group chat.
- [] Store symmetric encryption key that encrypts the history messages in client OP-TEE.
- [] History messages backup from old device to new device.

## Quick Start

### Build and run

For server project, first you need to add a `jdbc.properties` file which includes the ssh connection information and database information in `src/main/resources` like:

```bash
sshUser=aaa111
sshPassword=password
dbUser=username
dbPassword=password
```

The two projects both use gradle-wrapper, you can just open either of them in intellij or eclipse simply, and use the gradle tool inside the IDE to build and run the project.

You don't need to install the gradle, just run the following command in the project root folder like `socotra-server` or `socotra-client`:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

and to run the application:

```bash
./gradlew run
```

Or simply use the gradle gui tool inside the IDE(for intellij it's on the right side bar) to run these tasks.

### Junit test

Both two projects use `junit5` to write some tests exclude socket and GUI tests. To run the test, use the gradle tool `test` in menu `Tasks/verification` or use the command in the terminal:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

The test report will automatically generated by gradle in directory `build/reports/tests/test/index.html`.

### Archive and release

For server project, you can release the .jar file, you can archive the server project as:

```bash
./gradlew uploadArchives
```

then the `repos` foler will be generated with serveral .jar files.

For client project, it use `javafx11` to build the GUI, so once you use the gradle to generate a .jar file, you need to download javafx11 sdk first, and run it as following:

```bash
java --module-path $PATHTOJAVAFXSDK11 --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.base -jar $YOURCLIENT.jar
```

## Contributing

`NOTE: Please confirm that files under 'common' directory are same on both client and server project.`

First clone the project, and in your local git repository, create a new branch named as your name, for example:

```bash
git branch $YOURBRANCH
```

and then checkout to that branch:

```bash
git checkout $YOURBRANCH
```

Now, to check if you are in the right branch, use the command:

```bash
git branch -a
```

and the '*' will be infront of the current branch.

If you want to push your branch to the git repository, use the command:

```bash
git push origin $YOURBRANCH
```

Now you can do some change to your branch, once you have done your task, after testing the new function and commiting the change, first use command:

```bash
git checkout master
```

to checkout to the master branch, and then use the command to merge your branch to the master branch:

```bash
git merge $YOURBRANCH
```

Make sure before each commit, checkout your current branch first.
